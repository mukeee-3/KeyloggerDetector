# KeyloggerDetector
This is a CLI Based Simple Keylogger Detector made for my academic mini-project Which scans for keylogger by scanning the predifined keywords in the running process of a Windows and Linux System by listing it using the OS Commands.This also scans for Automatically Starting tasks in the Windows Registry Only Runned in Widows System.
